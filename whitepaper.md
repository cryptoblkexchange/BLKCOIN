1. **ABSTRACT**: technically, BSC is a standalone blockchain, instead of a layer-2 solution. Most BSC fundamental  technical and business functions should be self-contained so that it can     run well even if the BC stopped for a short period.
2. **VALUES**: The first practical and widely-used Smart Contract platform is Ethereum. To take advantage of the relatively mature applications and community, BSC chooses to be compatible with the existing Ethereum mainnet. This means most of the **dApps**, ecosystem components, and toolings will work with BSC and require zero or minimum changes; BSC node will require similar (or a bit higher) hardware specification and skills to run and operate. The implementation should leave room for BSC to catch up with further Ethereum upgrades.
3. **WHAT WE OFFER**: Staking-based consensus is more environmentally friendly and leaves more flexible option to the community governance. Expectedly, this consensus should enable better network performance over [proof-of-work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_work) blockchain system, i.e., faster blocking time and higher transaction capacity.
4. **OURTOKEN**: both BC and BSC will be implemented with native support for cross-chain communication among the two blockchains. The communication protocol should be bi-directional, decentralized, and trustless. It will concentrate on moving digital assets between BC and BSC, i.e., [BEP2](https://github.com/binance-chain/BEPs/blob/master/BEP2.md) tokens, and eventually, other BEP tokens introduced later. The protocol should care for the minimum of other items stored in the state of the blockchains, with only a few exceptions.
5. **TOKENOMICS**: both BC and BSC will be implemented with native support for cross-chain communication among the two blockchains. The communication protocol should be bi-directional, decentralized, and trustless. It will concentrate on moving digital assets between BC and BSC, i.e., [BEP2](https://github.com/binance-chain/BEPs/blob/master/BEP2.md) tokens, and eventually, other BEP tokens introduced later. The protocol should care for the minimum of other items stored in the state of the blockchains, with only a few exceptions.
6. **ROADMAP**: both BC and BSC will be implemented with native support for cross-chain communication among the two blockchains. The communication protocol should be bi-directional, decentralized, and trustless. It will concentrate on moving digital assets between BC and BSC, i.e., [BEP2](https://github.com/binance-chain/BEPs/blob/master/BEP2.md) tokens, and eventually, other BEP tokens introduced later.

## OUR TOKEN

Crypto tokens are a type of cryptocurrency that represents an asset or specific use and
reside on their blockchain. Tokens can be used for investment purposes, to store value, or to
make purchases. Our token is BLKCoin which is a new decentralized crypto token that
operates on the lightning-fast Binance network. This decentralized structure allows them to
exist outside the control of governments and central authorities. Because of the
decentralized nature of blockchain, a new concept of a token economy has emerged, in
which the community's revenue can be given to the content creators and service users who
provide value. We can promote this token, and as the value of the token rises, more people
will become aware of it, and the community will profit from it. This token is a profitable
return token because this token has many features like lock liquidity, burning, staking.
A liquidity pool is a crowdsourced pool of cryptocurrencies or tokens that are locked in a
smart contract and used to make trades between assets on a decentralized exchange (DEX).
Without ownership of LP tokens, developers cannot get liquidity pool funds back. A liquidity
locker allows the developer to hold these LP tokens in a smart contract, effectively robbing
him of the ability to move them from the start date (or, more precisely, a start block) to the
end date (end block). When it comes to DeFi initiatives, the Unicrypt liquidity locking service
is extensively used.
A cryptocurrency token is burned when it is delivered to an unusable wallet address to
remove it from circulation. No one can access or assign the address, which is known as a
burn address or eater address. When a token is transferred to a burn address, it is
permanently lost. Coin burning is a natural defense against DDOS attacks as well as network
congestion caused by spam transactions. Coin burning essentially signifies the project's
commitment to increasing the value of their coin.
Staking is a way to put your crypto to work and earn rewards on it. Staking cryptocurrency is
the process of committing your crypto assets to a blockchain network to support it and
confirm transactions. It's compatible with cryptocurrencies that process payments using the
proof-of-stake approach. Due to these features, people get more benefits it and more will
connect with them through this token and along with this their community get information
from the website, and as more people come they introduce new coins and tokens so people
can also use that coins and tokens to get more benefits


### TRADINGPLATFORM


A trading platform is a piece of software that allows investors and traders to
place deals and keep track of their accounts without the use of financial
intermediaries .Every time you purchase, sell or trade cryptocurrencies , you will
be charged a trading fee. You may notice additional percentages or other
unknown rates added to the basic price of the coin before or during the
transaction. Different trading/exchange fees , variable network fees ,and
exorbitant deposit/withdrawal fees might make the whole affair look a little
hazy . But in this platform, fewer trading fees are applied and al so provides take
rewards to the holders . So holders take more tokens and get more money . And
we also do a listing of our coins in the different platforms which boost up the
token and after boos ting people get more benefit s from it because the l i s ting
coin provides a lot of benefits like Eliminate Fraud Risk , Transaction Anonymity ,
Lower Operational Costs , Immediate Transactions , Security For Funds .

## CONCLUSION

This website is nonprofitable, which means it is solely for the goal of assisting
people and not for the purpose of making a profit. Their sole goal is to educate the
African people about cryptocurrency so that they can benefit from it. Investing in
cryptocurrency is both dangerous and beneficial. Cryptocurrency is a fantastic
investment if you want direct exposure to the demand for digital money, while
stocks of companies with cryptocurrency exposure are safer. BLKCoin is a very safe
and secure cryptocurrency. Many alterations and changes are taking place in this
world, just as many coins and tokens are emerging in the crypto world, and we're
talking about BLK, which is used to educate people and provide a lot of services
